# 📌 Theraiva - Interview Notes

> Comprehensive interview-ready explanations for the Theraiva AI Chat Assistant project.
> Covers technical components, AI integration, frontend design, Markdown rendering, database usage, and speaking tips.

## 1️⃣ Elevator Pitches

### 15-Second Pitch

*"I built Theraiva, an empathetic AI chat assistant for young adults experiencing stress or anxiety. It provides Markdown-formatted advice, remembers session context, and has a WhatsApp-style desktop UI."*

### 30-Second Pitch

*"Theraiva uses the Google Gemini AI SDK to generate empathetic, personalized advice for users aged 18–24. Messages are rendered with proper Markdown formatting, including headings, lists, and code blocks. The frontend is a full-screen, desktop-optimized, WhatsApp-inspired chat UI. Chat history persists locally, and the AI uses the user’s name when known."*

### 2-Minute STAR Explanation

**Situation:**
*"I wanted to demonstrate a full-stack AI project: conversational AI, frontend rendering, session management, and database integration."*

**Task:**
*"Build a project that allows young adults to receive safe, empathetic, and actionable advice through a chat interface, with a polished desktop experience."*

**Action:**

* Built **Flask backend** with endpoints to interact with Gemini AI SDK.
* Preloaded system messages and user context to guide AI responses, ensuring empathetic, practical advice in Markdown format.
* Stored session conversations in **MongoDB Atlas (free tier)** for personalization.
* Frontend implemented in **HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap**, with:

  * Full-screen, desktop WhatsApp-style layout
  * Proper handling of **GitHub-flavored Markdown** via `marked.js`
  * Syntax highlighting for code snippets using `highlight.js`
  * Typing indicator, fade-in animations, and Enter key functionality
* Session persistence using **localStorage** to restore conversation history on reload.

**Result:**
*"Theraiva demonstrates full-stack skills: AI integration, backend API design, Markdown rendering, database usage, and polished frontend design. The MVP is fully functional and presents a professional demo-ready interface for young adult users."*

## 2️⃣ Technical Breakdown

### 🛠 Backend & AI Integration

* **Flask** handles routes and API requests.
* **Gemini AI SDK** generates responses:

  * Preloaded system prompt ensures empathetic, safe, non-repetitive advice.
  * AI responses structured with Markdown, including headings, lists, bold/italic, links, blockquotes, and code blocks.
* **MongoDB Atlas** stores conversations for each session for future personalization.
* **Time Complexity:** O(1) per AI message call; latency depends on Gemini API response time.

### ⚡ Frontend & Markdown Rendering

* **Layout:** WhatsApp-inspired, desktop-optimized full-screen interface.
* **Chat UI Features:**

  * User and AI messages styled distinctly
  * Typing indicator with animated dots
  * Smooth fade-in animations for messages
  * Input supports Enter key or send button
* **Markdown Rendering:**

  * `marked.js` with GitHub-flavored Markdown (GFM)
  * `DOMPurify` sanitizes HTML
  * `highlight.js` highlights code blocks
* **Responsive Design:** Desktop-first; maintains full horizontal and vertical space.

### 🧠 Personalization & Session Management

* Users optionally enter their **name**; AI addresses user naturally.
* Session history stored in **localStorage** for immediate restoration.
* Conversations pushed to MongoDB to enable future improvements like memory and recommendation features.
